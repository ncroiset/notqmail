Changes in version 2.0

- Added support for modifying the message envelope as well as the body.

- If either the body or envelope output is empty, the input is reused
  as-is.

- Export the envelope size, the message size, and the number of
  recipients to filters through environment variables $ENVSIZE,
  $MSGSIZE, and $NUMRCPTS respectively.

- Added a work-around for systems that lack unsetenv (notably Solaris).

- Fixed a off-by-one bug in parsing sender addresses without an "@".

Changes in version 1.5

- Fixed a bug in handling the empty sender envelope.
- Added code to handle missing sender domains instead of rejecting them.
- Fixed a bug in handling empty messages.
- Don't close standard error when running filters so they can output log
  messages.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.4

- Added a new "drop message" exit code -- if the filter exits with code
  99, qmail-qfilter immediately exits successfully without calling
  qmail-queue.
- Some documentation fixups.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.3

- A new environment variable, "QMAILRCPTS" is set to a newline-seperated
  list of the recipients.  Note that if a large number of recipients are
  encountered (ex more than 64KB worth under Linux), this will cause
  execution of the filters to fail and the message will be rejected.  I
  consider this acceptable, since 64KB worth of recipients is likely
  more than 1000 anyways.
- Removed some GNU-specific constructs from the source and Makefile.
- Included a sample MIME filename extension scanning filter.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.2

- Fixed a couple of minor bugs in error return codes in run_filters.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 1.1

- Fixed a bug in building the linked list of commands to run.
