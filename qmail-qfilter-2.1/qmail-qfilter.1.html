<H2>NAME</H2>

qmail-qfilter - front end for qmail-queue that does filtering
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>qmail-qfilter</B>

<I>filter</I>

[
<I>-- filter ...</I>

]
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>qmail-qfilter</B>

sends the message text through each of the filter commands named on
the command line. 
Each filter is run seperately, with standard input opened to the input
email, and standard output opened to a new temporary file that will
become the input to either the next filter, or
<B>qmail-queue</B>.

If the filter does not modify the message it passes unchanged to the
next step.
It also makes the envelope avaliable to each filter as
file descriptor 3.  File descriptor 4 is opened to a new temporary file for the
modified envelope, allowing the filter to modify the envelope or the
message.  If the filter does not modify the envelope, the envelope
remains unchanged for either the next filter or 
<B>qmail-queue</B>.

This provides compatibility for existing filters that do not know about
the envelope.
<B>qmail-qfilter</B>

also opens up file descriptor 5 to a temporary file.  If this file is
empty after all the filters have executed, its contents are read and
used to specify a program to execute in place of
<B>qmail-queue</B>.

Each filter on the command line in seperated with
<B>--</B>.

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUES</H2>

Returns 51 (out of memory), 53 (write error), or 81 (internal error)
if it can't create the temporary files or has problems executing the
filters.
Returns 91 (bad envelope data) if it can't read or parse the envelope
data.
If a filter returns anything other than 0 or 99,
<B>qmail-qfilter</B>

returns its exit code.
If a filter returns 99,
<B>qmail-qfilter</B>

returns 0 immediately without running any other filters.
Otherwise returns the exit code of
<B>qmail-queue</B>.

<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2>

For cmpatibility with previous versions,
<B>qmail-qfilter</B>

sets
<B>QMAILUSER</B>

and
<B>QMAILHOST</B>

to the user and host portions of the envelope sender address, and
unsets
<B>QMAILNAME</B>.

It also sets
<B>QMAILRCPTS</B>

to the list of envelope recipients, each followed by a newline.

It also sets
<B>ENVSIZE</B>

to the size of the envelope,
<B>MSGSIZE</B>

to the length of the message, and
<B>NUMRCPTS</B>

to the number of recipients. These values are updated before each
filter is run.

If
<B>QQF_QMAILQUEUE</B>

is set, its value is used in place of
<B>qmail-queue</B>.

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

<B>$QMAILQUEUE</B>

is deliberately not used to override
<B>qmail-queue</B>

in order to avoid recursive loops with configurations that set
<B>$QMAILQUEUE</B>

to invoke
<B>qmail-qfilter</B>

itself.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>WARNINGS</H2>

If you are using
<B>qmail-inject -n</B>

as one of the filters, you may want to unset
<B>MAILUSER</B>,

<B>USER</B>,

and
<B>LOGNAME</B>

by using
<B>env -u QMAILNAME -u MAILNAME -u NAME qmail-inject -n</B>

as the command to invoke qmail-inject.
Note that some the
<B>env</B>

command with some OS's doesn't support the
<B>-u</B>

option.

A message with an excessive number of recipients (more than 64K bytes of
recipient data on Linux) will cause execution of the filter programs to
fail, and for the message to be rejected.

The same temporary file is reused for file descriptor 5 for each filter.
Make sure each filter writes a trailing ASCII NUL byte following the
program name, as multiple filters could otherwise overwrite the value in
undesireable ways.
